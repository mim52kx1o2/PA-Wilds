			<p>
				In Pennsylvania, we are lucky to have a natural inheritance of
				public land available for our responsible use and recreation known
				as the PA Wilds. The land is expansive, encompassing 29 state parks,
				300,000 acres of state gamelands, the Allegheny National Forest, and
				90,000 acres of “wilderness,” as designated by the federal
				government. Many residents of Pennsylvania and other states use the
				wilds as an affordable way to spend time outdoors, using the 1,100
				miles of hiking trails to get away from the commotion of busy city
				streets. Gamelands provide a space for hunters, fishers, and
				trappers to do these activities in a sustainable way, often helping
				the environments there. Scenic overlooks and walkways provide a way
				for families and friends to enjoy the natural beauty of land lightly
				touched by human intervention. The wilds offer some of the best
				stargazing in the state due to the low amounts of light pollution,
				especially when compared to the cities on either end of PA. <br>
				<br> With such abundant natural beauty, it is no wonder that an
				astounding 97% of Pennsylvanians support dedication of state funds
				for preserving our state’s natural spaces and historic sites. 90%
				agreed that the support an <em>increase</em> in state funding for
				these purposes (PA Land Trust). When people support the wilds, they
				not only support the continued human enjoyment of the land, but also
				a place where animals can thrive in their ecosystems that have only
				seen minimal impact. One such ecosystem is the old growth forest,
				which exists only in the Wilds territories of Pennsylvania. The
				Pennsylvania elk herd calls this area home. Bald eagles use these
				large trees in order to nest. These are not animals that will
				stumble into your back yard like whitetail deer or raccoons. These
				rarer species stick closer to the habitats that support them the
				best. Having these habitats close to home means people can
				responsibly use these environments and watch the animals in their
				natural habitats, while without them, these animal populations would
				surely suffer. Polls show that protecting the wilds is not a
				partisan issue, but an issue for every resident of Pennsylvania.

			<h3 class="w3-padding-16 w3-text-light-grey">Threats to the
				Wilds</h3>
			<hr style="width: 200px" class="w3-opacity">
			<p class="w3-wide">Leave No (or at barely any) Trace</p>
			<p>With any beautiful public land, there will always those who
				would rather reap the maximum possible financial benefit from it,
				rather than using it responsibly and protecting it. LaKeshia Knarr,
				an Outreach Specialist for the PA Wilds Center, describes
				conservation of the wilds as “the great balancing act that is a
				multiple-use working forest.” The PA Wilds are not protected by the
				federal government to the degree that the US National Parks are. For
				this reason, it is impossible to expect that all resource harvesting
				will cease. Fracking companies will come to harvest the natural gas
				from the Marcellus Shale gas deposit underneath the lands of the
				wilds. Logging companies will come to harvest the wood that will be
				used for lumber. But this does not mean that their impacts cannot be
				mitigated.</p>
			<p>A common ethical code that many outdoors enthusiasts practice
				is called “Leave No Trace” or LNT. In short, this ethical system
				states that when a human is in a wild space, we must strive to make
				as little as possible, if any impact on the environment. This means
				not littering, putting out your campfires (if you must make them in
				the first place), and being a responsible guest to your wild hosts.
				By following these ethics, one can leave as little evidence of human
				impact on an area as possible. While it is important that all
				visitors to the wilds practice these ethics, they can also be
				applied to more than just the individual visitors to a wild place.
				In fact, through the continued efforts of voters and activists, many
				companies have had to embrace them.</p>
			<p>For example, for fracking companies to obtain the natural gas
				that they want from the ground, they must drill several thousand
				meters underground, past the fresh water supply, and into the shale
				deposits where the natural gas sits. Before they can even start
				drilling, they must often make roads that lead to their sites so
				that their trucks can access these spots. Then, as they drill
				underground, using “fracking water” shot through concrete tubes to
				get to the gas. For years, no one outside the industry knew what was
				in the fracking water. They did not have to disclose what chemicals
				were being used.</p>
			<p>Upon the initial discovery of the Marcellus Shale deposit,
				companies fracked with no recourse and without thought given to what
				might happen to the environment. Water supplies were tainted
				, habitats were destroyed (Scientific American), rules were broken, and
				as a result, wild spaces and drinking reservoirs (for both humans
				and animals) were severely harmed. But the companies started to get
				a lot of pushback from voters, and in turn, politicians. A Supply
				Chain Manager from Seneca Resources, a prominent energy company that
				fracks in Pennsylvania, said that “There’s a lot more incentive for
				companies to be clean and efficient these days… Not to mention that
				now, if we have some kind of environmental issue, it can cost us
				tens of thousands of dollars,” (interview). The fines that he is
				referring to come from Act 13 (LINK HERE), a PA law that concluded
				that irresponsible fracking lead to a breach in the PA
				Constitution’s guarantee to clean air and water for its residents.
				This act was a direct result of sustained political action and
				activism. With the right efforts, politicians will listen to the
				voters who elected (and more importantly, will re-elect them), and
				even large companies can be held at bay. Likewise, that mystery
				substance that they used to use as fracking water is now public
				knowledge and available at
				https://fracfocus.org/chemical-use/what-chemicals-are-used for
				public viewing. They are required by law to disclose these chemicals
				now so the people who are affected can always stay informed.</p>
			<p>This principle of action is not only true with fracking, but
				also with logging and any other industries that look to use the
				wilds to harvest natural resources. Fracking companies are not
				perfect – no one is. If they are to be kept at bay, Pennsylvania
				citizens must not let down their guards. It is your concern that
				fuels the actions of the politicians and executives.</p>

				<h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">Take Action</h2>
				<hr style="width: 200px" class="w3-opacity">
				<p class="w3-wide">Stewardship is Possible For All – It Has
					Happened Before</p>
				<p>In the case of harvesting natural resources, less action is
					more. However, there are some cases where direct action is needed.
					The reinstatement of the Pennsylvania elk herd is one such example.
					Up until around the mid 1800’s, PA had a strong elk population.
					These large animals lived mostly in the northern parts of
					Pennsylvania, in areas that are now designated as the wilds. Elk
					county was even named for its prevalence of the animal. But due too
					deforestation and over-hunting, the elk population diminished. By
					the 1850’s, the once strong population had been relegated to only a
					few counties in the northern section of the state.</p>
				<p>By the early 1900’s, elk became practically extinct in the
					state of Pennsylvania. However, in 1912, Joseph Kalbfus, the
					Executive Secretary of the PA Game Commission seized an opportunity
					to reinstate the population. Elk ran rampant in Yellowstone
					National Park and the Jackson Hole Refuge Area. Overpopulation of
					any animal can be as destructive for an ecosystem as
					underpopulation. The elk in the area took up too many the
					resources. Animals often died of starvation and disease as a result
					of the overpopulation. This unbalanced ecosystem affected every
					species of plant and animal in the areas. The PA Game Commission
					organized for some of the elk herd to be taken to Pennsylvania,
					where they could re-populate the former elk lands. The commission
					has been monitoring elk populations ever since, and they have seen
					an impressive resurgence.</p>
				<p>The elk herd now numbers over a thousand (reference needed)
					with numbers focused in Elk and surrounding counties. The presence
					of the elk also helps quell the deer whitetail deer population. It
					is important to note that without human intervention, the elk would
					not have become extinct in our state in the first place. It is also
					important to recognize when we have caused damage to our ecosystems
					but still have the ability to reverse some of that damage.
					Stewardship is not impossible. In fact, with the right care and
					resources, improvements have been, and can continue to be made. The
					PA Game Commission also continues to do great work, aiming to
					re-populate the state with more native species, such as upland
					birds. In order for them, and organizations like them, to make
					these positive strides, resources are needed. Hunters can help by
					buying licenses, following state and local hunting laws, and always
					reporting their harvests to the game commission so that they can
					keep tabs on animal populations.</p>
				<p class="w3-wide">Visit!</p>
				<p>One of the easiest and most enjoyable ways to support the
					wilds is to visit! When you go to visit the wilds, you are doing
					more than just enjoying nature (although for many, that is enough
					motivation!). You are helping boost the local economy. Purchasing
					passes to camp, as well as shopping at local stores help the people
					who work in the area, and help the wilds gain the money that can go
					back into conservation. Of course, the wilds provide a great place
					to camp, hunt, or enjoy nature, but there are also opportunities
					for those who do not particularly enjoy the being outside for so
					long.. Events throughout the year (add hyperlink in web page)
					provide opportunities to shop for handmade goods, buy local
					produce, and enjoy holiday-themed fun for the whole family. Each
					event provides an opportunity to help small businesses who have a
					smaller environmental impact on the area than larger corporations
					(LaKeshia Knarr).</p>
				<p class="w3-wide">Don’t wait for someone else. It’s on you to
					be the good steward</p>
				<p>There will always be those who abuse wild spaces. There will
					always be people who throw empty beer cans into the woods when they
					camp, let their shopping-bag-trash-cans blow away, or hunt over
					their legal bag limits. This is why it is all the more important
					for those who truly care for the wilds to be stewards. The first
					step is to connect – or reconnect – with the outdoors. A trip out
					to the beauty that the wilds offer is often all the motivation a
					person needs to act to protect it. Beyond that, there are
					opportunities provided by the PA Department of Conservation and
					Natural Resources for people to come and clean up the landscape. It
					is not right to have to clean up someone else’s mess, but it is a
					small price to pay to maintain our state’s natural beauty.</p>
				<p>As a Pennsylvanian, it is your civic duty to vote. As a
					steward of the wilds, it is your duty to vote for those who, like
					you, will protect them. Politicians listen to their voters so they
					can get into office and get re-elected. We hold them accountable
					with our votes. If they know that their constituents care deeply
					for the environment, they will vote in favor of protecting it. It
					has happened before in the case of limiting and regulating
					fracking, and it can happen again with our continued efforts. You
					can always look for your potential public officials’ voting records
					manually, checking how they voted for each law and referendum.
					However, the internet has made it much easier. There are now plenty
					of online resources like this one
					(http://scorecard.lcv.org/members-of-congress) that show you. Or
					simply scroll down to see a few of the environmental standouts from
					our great state. And if you have the means, consider donating to
					conservation agencies that put in the leg work to keep the PA Wilds
					what they were always meant to be – wild.</p>
